            After Effects. It's the "high tier" of video editing, and defenetly the best software for editing. After Effects gives you truly infinite possibilities. It has even more features than anyone would need. Create Movies. Make Edits. Edit your Youtube videos. Create animations. You can do all of this, and even more with After Effects, if you're skilled enough. The best thing is that it all wi ll be perfect, if you're skilled enough. However, for a smooth work, After Effect requires a powerful computer, that costs at least $800-$1000.

            If all why you need the software for editing is cutting the video, speeding it up, or other basic stuff, you don't need After Effects. For that purposes, you can use any other, less severe software for editing videos, like <a href="">Premiere Pro</a>, or <a href="">Sony Vegas</a>. Maybe even mobile apps, like <a href="">CapCut</a> and <a href="">Alight Motion</a>. But if you're interested in upgrading your skills in editing, and you have a powerful computer, you defenetly need AE. For the first time, when you're just exploring the editing, mobile apps and simple software would be enough for you, but when you're skilled enough, you will start feeling constrained by the abilities of the software. That's when you have to move to AE.
